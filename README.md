# local_Directory_Scraper

## Problem
Working in nonprofits community outreach is our number one priority. It would take hours to manually scrape the chamber websites for contact info.

## Solution
Instead of going through the chamber websites one by one I created a simple scraper to output all the information in a very simple excel sheet. This saved my team hours of manual scraping and connected us to businesses in the area.
A bonus was discovered when I found that most chamber directories have the same layout and html design. This should work with most chamber websites.
